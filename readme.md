# Firebase CMS

The point of this repository is to create a basic engine with which one can consume either structural configurations to generate websites on the fly based on templates, consume content data to populate a basic website with content from firebase, or both.

**The goal is for users to be able to drop the `/src/api/` contents in the root of the directory where they want the website and start creating templates in the `templates` folder. All of the site configurations will be described in the `/src/api/configs/firebaseCms.json`.
